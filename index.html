            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Abdul-Barcky, a passionate front-end developer with a love for
                clean design, smooth user experiences, and building things that solve
                real problems. I specialize in crafting responsive, accessible
                websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, I'm often exploring design trends, diving into
                open-source projects, or writing about tech. My goal is to keep
                learning and collaborating with people who want to make the web
                better. Whether it's building from scratch or improving existing
                platforms, I enjoy turning ideas into interactive, usable interfaces.
            </p>

                    Here are some of my recent projects that showcase my skills in
                    front-end development and design. Each project reflects my commitment
                    to clean code, responsive design, and user-centered experiences.

                            call-to-actions, and modern UI/UX principles, ensuring users are

                            Rainy days have a way of slowing everything down, making space for quiet reflection and warm
                            cups of coffee. This post is just one of those slower moments I like to capture
                            here—alongside pages about creative projects, bits of code, and everyday thoughts. If you’ve
                            explored the blog, you’ll know it’s a mix of calm, curiosity, and the occasional deep
                            breath—just like today.
